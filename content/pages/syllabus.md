Nise, Norman S. _Control Systems Engineering_. 4th ed. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley, 2003. ISBN: 9780471445777.

Problem Sets
------------

Problem sets are due in class as shown on the class schedule.

Quizzes
-------

There will be two quizzes as shown on the class schedule.

Final Examination
-----------------

There will be a three hour final examination (closed book) covering all of the course material during the final examination period; the exact time to be scheduled by the Registrar's Office.

Grading
-------

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Quizzes (2) | 20% |
| Final exam | 30% |
| Labs (required) | 25% |
| Homework | 25% 

### Homework Grading

3 points/problem: 3=perfect, 2=small mistake(s), 1=major mistake(s), 0=no attempt.

### Lab Grading

3 points/lab: 3=exemplary, 2=adequate, 1=fair, 0=inadequate or no show.

### Late Policies

20% of the grade will be deducted for every working day past the due date (i.e., no credit after 5 days).

Course Ethics
-------------

Collaboration is prohibited in the quizzes and the final examination. You are encouraged to discuss problem sets and lab assignments but you must write the solutions yourselves.

Use of material from previous years is forbidden.
